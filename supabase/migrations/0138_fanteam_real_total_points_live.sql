-- Fix: FanTeam's "Total Pts" column showing LAST season's total, not
-- this season's (2026-08-23 user report - "fanteam is showing last
-- years points total too"). game_player_pool's real_total_points has
-- always come from game_player_stats' gameweek=0 season-aggregate row
-- ("most recent by created_at") - correct for Dream Team, whose seed
-- script re-captures that row from a real live endpoint every run (see
-- seed_dreamteam_historical_stats.py). FanTeam has no such re-seeding
-- step: its most recent game_player_stats gameweek=0 row is a stale
-- 2025/26 snapshot from 2026-07-16 (confirmed live for Haaland:
-- total_points=239.60, season='2025/26') that nothing has ever
-- refreshed for the new season.
--
-- FanTeam DOES have a real, live, correctly-current-season source
-- already being captured every refresh cycle and already joined into
-- this exact view (as fanteam_status) for lineup/status/form: real
-- confirmed for Haaland, total_points=0/4.1 across two real scraped
-- gameweek rows dated 2026-08-23, not last season. This migration adds
-- total_points to that existing lateral join and prefers it over the
-- stale game_player_stats snapshot - real_stats stays the fallback for
-- every other game (Cloud FF/EFL Fantasy/Dream Team), unaffected.
