-- Extends search_game_player_pool (0099/0100) with p_exclude_club - EFL
-- Fantasy's "Players" tab with the position filter set to "ALL" needs
-- every GK/DEF/MID/FWD row but explicitly NOT the CLUB picks (a separate
-- tab/pool of its own, see migration 0087's docstring), which p_position
-- alone can't express (null means "no filter at all", one exact value
-- means "only this one"). No other game has any CLUB rows, so this is a
-- no-op everywhere else.
